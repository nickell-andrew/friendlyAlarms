Kyle "Pro" Cho's Collaborative Alarms

  A reminder/alarm tool that allows friends to send eachother timed reminders/alarms

  A powerful yet simple tool for collaberation and social organization in the cell phone age. Alarms for Friends allows people to send text or audio messages to their friends, and further they can delay their delivery till a later time. Remind all your friends of your birthday party later today, no longer relying on the mass of invitation via facebook, google+ etc.

## Problem ##
  A tool for type A personalities to slightly encourage timely behavior in their inferior counterparts, aquaintances. Examples: Reminding your mother to pick you up from your flight. Rather than sending a text before you get on the plane, you send an Alarm and it alerts her 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes (your choice) before your plane is due to land.


## Solution ##
  This tool gives users with a need the ability to do the leg work required for coordination, rather than relying on due diligence from users offering favors.
